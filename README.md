# WaveClassifier
Neural network that identifies a wave's shape.

Run classifier_tensorflow.py to train 3 4-layer NNs with diferent hyperparameters using frequency generator data and produce accuracy results for each NN. 
Raw data as collected is stored as binary files in datasets/raw/ and contains sine, square, sawtooth, and burst waves.
Preprocessed data is stored in csv files in datasets/tables/.
